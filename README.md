# FP Growth
This project is a simple Python implementation of the FP-Grwoth algorithm used for knowledge discovery in 
databases. I implemented this as a learning example for recursive tree algorithms.

You can find the used example [here](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/understanding-fp-growth-algorithm/).

Cheers, Lucas.

# Usage
Just install the requirements using pip (or any other package management tool):

`pip -r install requirements.txt`

Just run the file with:

`python FpGrowth.py`

to see an example from the previously mentioned website.
